# Cock Hero Player
Browser based application that provides an universal platform for easy creation and playback of [Cock Hero](https://www.cockhero.info) custom games.
It works very simple - in a similar way any other multimedia player does - just put your favorite video, music and beats into playlist and play them synchronized.
## Key Features
* JavaScript enabled local HTML page (runable under CHROME, FIREFOX or EDGE)
* Only browser is required, no need for other special SW installation (like DB, WebServer, ...)
* Plays local files (audio and video tracks arranged in queues)
* Customized or autogenerated beats (various beat patterns aligned with music)
* Supports playlists (share created games with the community)
## Installation
1. Simply download and copy the repository into your local disk (anywhere you like - e.g. *C:\\ch-apps\\player\\* )
1. Run the player by opening the index.html page in your preffered web browser (double-clicking it should open it in default browser on most systems)

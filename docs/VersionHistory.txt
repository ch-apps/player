WISH-LIST
	- Advanced looping and chaining logic (video drives timing/looping, audio drives timing/looping, independent playback)
	- Security and Error/ Exception handling and source code clean-up
	- Add more content
 		- Documentation
			- Usage
			- Content Creation How-to
		- Supporting utilities [utilities section]
			- BEAT auto-generator (based on BPM and beat-patterns) 
			- Efficient BEAT mapping to music (to produce JSON file) something like BeatMeter Generator
		- Sample files

0.3.1	Displaying messages
	- Display TEXT MESSAGES together with beats as a part of beatmeter (e.g. pattern change announcement, instructions. etc.)
	- Both JSON and JS files formats supported as BeatFiles. 
	- Playlist validator (throws alert when file not found or unsupported extension)

0.3.0	Video start/stop time support
	- media (audio/video) buffering (next media is pre-loaded to minimize playback delay)
	- Start-time and stop-time support for video in playlist files (enables to play only time-defined clips out of the full-length videos. Just add ?start=12&stop=15 to the end of video filename)
	- Split the code (ch-player.js) into multiple files

0.2	First public release (GitHub)

0.1.f	Support of PLAYLIST
	- Open (and Edit and Save in the future) of Playlist file with ready to play arrangements (stored as JSON file)
0.1.e	Beat track auto generator
	- Generate BEAT data based on song's BPM only (when customized data file with beats is not available)
0.1.d	Multiple files chaining
	- Multiple files selection allowed
	- Chain multiple files (aka playlist feature)	
	- Basic track dependency (chaining) logic (video drives timing, audio plays independently, beats track locked to audio track)
0.1.c	Player layout designed
	- Colors, styles and layout
	- Project / web application directory structure set (separation of styles, scripts, html, assets and media content)
0.1.b	Simple "playable" release
	- Custom content (AUDIO, VIDEO) to play upload feature (single file only - no chaining)
	- Custom BEAT data file (JSON) to visualize beatmeter 
	- Full screen option
	- Volume-mix sliders (set-up audio, video and beat click volumes independently) 
0.1.a	Initial proof of concept


	- Intro video/audio to bundle with
